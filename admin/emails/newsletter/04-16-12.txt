                         Emacs Club this Week
                         ====================

Hi Everyone, 

Command of the Week 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  `M-x man': Look up a man page entry, display it in an Emacs buffer.
  This is super useful because clicking on links in the man page, such
  as C source files or other man references, will open those up in
  Emacs as well. 

Next Meeting 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Our next meeting will be tomorrow, Tuesday April 11th, in
  Skirkanich 508. We'll finally tackle checking email with Emacs,
  given enough interest in this topic. Food will be Potbelly
  sandwiches. 


Cheers,
Mish
