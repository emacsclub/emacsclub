                         Emacs Club this Week
                         ====================

Hi all,

Command of the Week 
--------------------
  
  ~M-:~ Evaluate an elisp expression. This is useful for things like 
  rebinding a key on the fly. For instance, if you wanted to set ~C-c
  c~ to run ~M-x compile <RET>~, you could evaluate

  (global-set-key "\C-cc" 'compile)


Next Meeting 
-------------

  Instead of our usual meeting in Skirkanich 508, tomorrow we will
  join each other at the Philly Lambda group's talk on Clojure, in
  Levine 315 at 6:30pm. Clojure is a dialect of lisp (just like
  Elisp!) that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. Please join us if you
  have an interest in functional programming.

  
Cheers,
Mish
