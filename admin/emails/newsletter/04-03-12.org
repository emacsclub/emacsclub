Thanks everyone for coming out to last week's meeting. 

This week, we will continue to build on flymake to enable it for other
popular languages such as Java and Python. If we manage to get all
that done and still have time, we'll go over previous topics anyone
might have questions about. We will be having Potbelly sandwiches
today. 

* Command of the Week

  ~C-c v~ : eval-buffer (works only for elisp buffers)
  ~C-x m~ : runs the emacs shell (much better than normal shell for
  most situations!)

* Next Meeting

  Today, Tuesday, April 3rd at 6pm in Skirkanich 508. 


Cheers,
Mish
