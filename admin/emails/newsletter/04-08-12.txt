                         Emacs Club this Week
                         ====================

Hi Everyone,

Command of the Week 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Just as some CTRL combos have Meta amplifiers, an important one to
  remember is the deletion amplifiers which work on words instead of characters.

  `<DEL>' : Delete a character backwards.
  `M-<DEL>' : Delete a word in the backward direction. 

  `C-d': Delete a character in the forward direction.
  `M-d' : Delete a word in the forward direction.

Next Meeting 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Thanks to Zach for discovering some useful ido packages which we
  will discuss, namely ido-ubiquitous, smex, as well as an alternative
  to the Emacs Starter Kit, the Emacs Prelude (which I guess is named
  after Haskell's Prelude). The ido packages integrate themselves into
  M-x calls, so you have a list of frequently used functions
  available which is pretty nice. Here are the relevant links if you are
  curious: 

  - [Prelude]
  - [Smex]
  - [Ido-ubiquitous]

  We'll work more on flymake if everyone is interested, we have yet to
  delve into Python's flymake integration, which is pretty sexy when
  you include the PEP8 style too. 

  Another topic I'd like to discuss is Emacs 24, and how it will make
  some of our current packages obsolete in the future. 


Cheers,
Mish
