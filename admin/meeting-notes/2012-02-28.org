* Meeting Notes 2012-02-28
** Setup
    - *Max Mintz*: What is this for?
      - *Everyone*: Emacs club!
      - *Max Mintz*: You're a bunch of geeks!
    - *John*: Can I borrow your dongle?
    - Zach proposes a golf-style competition (with the vim club).
    - Zach is ordering pizza -- and sees a deal!
      - *Lauren*: Don't get taken in by that deal! You have to order $10. That's the reason I had two salads and a pizza yesterday.
    - *Adam Aviv*: So is there a rival vim club?
      - *Zach*: They're still trying to get into text mode.
** Java
    - *Mish*: Who can give me a recursive find?
      - *Adam* (slowly): ~find . -name~
   - John actually starts talking about java.
    - We watch the emacs java tutorial video, and add MST3000-style commentary.
      - *Rafe*: This guy uses K&R for his indentation...
      - *Andrew*: He also codes in Comic Sans!
	- It's not Comic Sans, it's Liberation Silly.
      - Zach really wants the autoindentation. Minus the font.
    - *Mish*: Scanning for forkbombs? Why don't you use the forkbomb scanners.
      - *Andrew*: I wanted to submit a forkbomb for 551.
    - The java tools are out-of-date.
      - *Andrew*: Has nobody used this thing in 15 years?
      - *John*: That's a good question.
      - They use JDK 1.4.
    - John gets bored with figuring out Java versions and switches to playing
      Minecraft.
      - *Mish*: It's ridiculous! John has robots mining his shafts.
      - He's programming robots in Lua.
      - *John*: It should be rewritten in elisp.
      - *Adam*: I don't get the point of Minecraft.
	- *Mish*: Haven't you seen what everyone has built?
	- *Adam*: I've ignored it.
      - *Rafe*: You guys have seen stoogebot, right? They exploited the Quake
        network protocol.
      - Writing game hacks is difficult.
	- *Rafe*: You have to have intimate knowledge of how everything works.
	- *Andrew*: So intimate.
    - *Mish*: Should we make our own JDE then?
** yasnippet
    - Andrew reintroduces himself.
      - *Andrew*: Hi guys! My name is Andrew Braunstein.
      - *Lauren*: Hi Andrew.
      - *Zach*: Hi Andrew.
    - *Andrew*: Every C program has a main function.
      - *Rafe*: That's not true.
    - Growl notifications appear on the projector (showing Andrew's laptop)
      - *John Mayer*: sup zach
      - *John Mayer*: meister that is
    - Andrew opens a new Chrome window.
      - *John*: emacsclub is on your Fave 8? Nice.
    - *Andrew*: I don't know what yasnappits are installed for Java.
      - Are you feeling lucky?
        - Or he could just check, with yas/find-snippets.
    - *Zach*: AC mode? How is that different from hippie-expand?
    - Andrew can autocomplete the keyword "class" or the entire class template.
      - *Andrew*: It's yasnippit and ac-mode working together!
      - *Nick*: You can do the same thing in vim. [begins explaining]
      - *John*: We don't care.
    - The yasnippit is completed!
      - *Andrew*: Aaah! Main!
    - *John*: ~clifford = new Dog();~ !
    - The author line is filled in.
      - *Andrew*: Johan Andersson!
    - Andrew autocompletes a list. It appears as ~List<Dog> bfd = new List<Dog>();~
      - Rafe complains that you can't instantiate an interface, and thinks
	this deficiency reflects poorly on the snippet library.
      - But wait! One more tab will let you choose ArrayList or LinkedList!
      - *Rafe*: Damn! They're smarter than I am. ... But what if I
        want to use a TreeList?
      - Now Rafe's just trolling.
    - *Rafe*: I think we should all pitch in and get a Lisp machine.
    - *Mish*: Why are you in vim?
      - *Andrew*: This is less.
      - *Mish*: So less is vim.
      - Mish is disappointed.
** The Aftermath
   - We are now all playing with http://wwwtyro.github.com/keyzen .
     - *Rafe*: SO IT HAS COME TO THIS
     - Rafe has been waiting to make that xkcd reference the entire session.
   - *Andrew*: Is that my dongle?
