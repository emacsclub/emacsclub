* Meeting Notes 2012-02-21
  - Tess mentions to Max Mintz that she's learning vim. He admonishes
    her for choosing the wrong editor.
    - *Tess*: His eyes lit up and flames came out of his nostrils.
  - It is a (common?) misconception that emacs and vim are basically the
    same thing.
    - *Rafe*: They're not the same at all. Our software isn't held
      together with duct tape, it's held together with parentheses.
  - At 6:12, the meeting hasn't started.
    - *Zach*: Are we waiting for pizza?
  - *Rafe*: Someone should have a talk on easter eggs.
    - *Zach*: M-x zone
    - *Rafe*: M-x psychoanalyze-pinhead
      - I have SEEN the CONSING!!
  - Andrew wonders if he has to use the projector or if we can follow
    along on our own computers. 
    - *Andrew*: I trust you to be able to do some things.
    - *John*: Wait, I haven't installed emacs yet.
  - John discovers the info page entry on SMTP.
  - John discovers wikipedia-mode.el.
  - Now that CETS made seas.upenn.edu point to the web server instead
    of eniac, connecting to eniac via tramp is slightly more
    difficult. Maybe they should change it back?
  - Andrew complains that if you C-x C-f a file in a directory that
    doesn't exist, it won't automatically run M-x make-directory.
    - Mish suggests he fix it.
    - He will name it braunstein-mode.
  - *Andrew*: There's this guy on twitter, @emacs_knight. You should follow him.
  - *Andrew*: There's a caculator in emacs, C-x * *. I believe that it
    works in mysterious ways.
    - It's Reverse Polish Notation.
    - *Rafe*: Someone should make a TI-83 emulator in elisp.
  - There is, once again, a dongle of unknown owner.
    - *Mish*: As long as we say the word "dongle" once per session.
  - Topics for next session?
    - Andrew wants to talk about the mark stack and C-u C-<SPC>.
      - *Mish*: That might be overkill.
    - hexl-mode
      - *Mish*: It'll be useful in Network Security class.
    - C-x C-x
