Flymake Tutorial

* Requirements
  You will need Flymake to be installed in Emacs, which is already
  the case if you have Emacs version 23 or higher.
* Setup 
  
** C Files
   You need to have a C file you will be editing, with its respective
   Makefile already in the directory. Your Makefile should include 
   the following for flymake to use

   #+begin_src BSDmakefile-mode
   .PHONY: check-syntax
   
   check-syntax:
       $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -Wall -Wextra -0pedantic -fsyntax-only $(SRCS)
   #+end_src
       
   Make sure you use a ~<TAB>~ under the target!

** Init file configuration
   Place the following code in your emacs init file 

   #+begin_src elisp-mode
   ;; Customize how flymake displays the errors
   '(flymake-errline ((((class color)) (:underline "OrangeRed"))))
   '(flymake-warnline ((((class color)) (:underline "yellow"))))
   
   ;; Define our own flymake error function
   (defun my-flymake-show-next-error ()
     (interactive)
     (flymake-goto-next-error)
     (flymake-display-err-menu-for-current-line))
   
   ;; And set it to the shortcut C-c C-v
   (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
     (lambda ()
       (flymake-mode t)
       (global-set-key "\C-c\C-v" 'my-flymake-show-next-error)))
   #+end_src

   This will set ~C-c C-v~ to show the next error in your c files,
   and makes the errors display a little more clearly.
