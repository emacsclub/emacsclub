Meeting Notes 2012-01-19

* We enter a meditation of M-x zone.
* Guest lectures
  - Perry should give a lecture sometime. Probably not the first one though.
* Editor usage
  - The outbreak of vim-usage on campus is probably Sam Panzer's fault.
  - A lot of professors use emacs.
    - Max Mintz uses chalk.
  - Andrew recounts the story of some guy.
    - *Andrew* : Do you know what emacs does?
    - *Guy* : I know you can play tetris in it.
* Topics
  - *Zach* : I wanna learn awesome shit. Also some lisp.
    - Zach also wants to learn how to get line numbers to work.
  - Andrew proposes extending to general command-line fu.
    - *Zach* : We should just call it the neckbeard club.
  - *Andrew* : EMACS COMMAND OF THE WEEK!
* Administration
  - *John* : Treasury? We don't have money.
  - John will be pressing the "send email" button.
  - *John* : Gauging interest in leadership... I'm going to do all the work,
             I think you all decided on that.
    - John Mayer for president!
  - *John* : We need to add all the cool things you do to the repo.
    - *Mish* : Add them! You said you'd do everything.
    - *John* : I'm delegating.
* Mobile Devices
  - *Andrew* : They ported vim to the iPad. We should port emacs to the iPad.
  - *John* : Is the issh screen too small to do anything?
    - *Andrew, Zach* : Yes.
    - *Zach* : You can restart your server from your phone but that's about it.
    - *Andrew* : You can also ssh in and forkbomb eniac.
      - John will be targeting a random 505 student with forkbombs.
* Publicity
  - *Andrew* : We should get CJ to post to everyone in his class last semester.
  - *Zach* : I can just post on Piazza and force it to send to everyone.
  - We will be collaboratively editing the email.
    - *Mish* : Google doc!
    - *Andrew* : Emacs!
  - Copying text from emacs into gmail is inefficient, compared to sending mail from emacs.
  - *John* : I really want our motto to be Never Too Late To :q
    - Never use vim. If you don't have emacs, use nano, or ed.
  - Zach requests pizza.
    - *John* : If we get food, then we're set.
* Meeting Structure
  - Separate meetings for beginners and power users (though anyone can come to both).
    - *Mish* : If nobody shows up to the lecture we can just have one of our hack sessions.
  - We need a logo.
* Misc.
  - Some guy stops by to retreive his gloves.
  - John registers localbriefs.com, for briefs of local news. Then he got the mental image of "local underwear."
    - *John* : I think I could still spin it into something useful though.
  - *Mish* : You can mark sections with C-<SPC> and the arrow keys.
    - *Andrew* : What arrow keys?
  - Zach is already that guy who plays with M-x zone.
