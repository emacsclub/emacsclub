Meeting Notes 2012-02-28

* Setup
   - *Max Mintz*: What is this for?
     - *Everyone*: Emacs club!
     - *Max Mintz*: You're a bunch of geeks!
   - *John*: Can I borrow your dongle?
   - Zach proposes a golf-style competition (with the vim club).
   - Zach is ordering pizza -- and sees a deal!
     - *Lauren*: Don't get taken in by that deal! You have to order
       $10. That's the reason I had two salads and a pizza
       yesterday.
   - *Adam Aviv*: So is there a rival vim club?
     - *Zach*: They're still trying to get into text mode.
* Java
   - *Mish*: Who can give me a recursive find?
     - *Adam* (slowly): ~find . -name~
  - John actually starts talking about java.
   - We watch the emacs java tutorial video, and add MST3000-style
     commentary.
     - *Rafe*: This guy uses K&R for his indentation...
     - *Andrew*: He also codes in Comic Sans!
       - It's not Comic Sans, it's Liberation Silly.
     - Zach really wants the autoindentation. Minus the font.
   - *Mish*: Scanning for forkbombs? Why don't you use the forkbomb scanners.
     - *Andrew*: I wanted to submit a forkbomb for 551.
   - The java tools are out-of-date.
     - *Andrew*: Has nobody used this thing in 15 years?
     - *John*: That's a good question.
     - They use JDK 1.4.
   - John gets bored with figuring out Java versions and switches to
     playing Minecraft.
     - *Mish*: It's ridiculous! John has robots mining his shafts.
     - He's programming robots in Lua.
     - *John*: It should be rewritten in elisp.
     - *Adam*: I don't get the point of Minecraft.
       - *Mish*: Haven't you seen what everyone has built?
       - *Adam*: I've ignored it.
     - *Rafe*: You guys have seen stoogebot, right? They exploited
       the Quake network protocol.
     - Writing game hacks is difficult.
       - *Rafe*: You have to have intimate knowledge of how
         everything works.
       - *Andrew*: So intimate.
   - *Mish*: Should we make our own JDE then?
* yasnippet
   - Andrew reintroduces himself.
     - *Andrew*: Hi guys! My name is Andrew Braunstein.
     - *Lauren*: Hi Andrew.
     - *Zach*: Hi Andrew.
   - *Andrew*: Every C program has a main function.
     - *Rafe*: That's not true.
   - Growl notifications appear on the projector (showing Andrew's
     laptop)
     - *John Mayer*: sup zach
     - *John Mayer*: meister that is
   - Andrew opens a new Chrome window.
     - *John*: emacsclub is on your Fave 8? Nice.
   - *Andrew*: I don't know what yasnappits are installed for Java.
     - Are you feeling lucky?
       - Or he could just check, with yas/find-snippets.
   - *Zach*: AC mode? How is that different from hippie-expand?
   - Andrew can autocomplete the keyword "class" or the entire class
     template.
     - *Andrew*: It's yasnippit and ac-mode working together!
     - *Nick*: You can do the same thing in vim. [begins explaining]
     - *John*: We don't care.
   - The yasnippit is completed!
     - *Andrew*: Aaah! Main!
   - *John*: ~clifford = new Dog();~ !
   - The author line is filled in.
     - *Andrew*: Johan Andersson!
   - Andrew autocompletes a list. It appears as ~List<Dog> bfd = new
     List<Dog>();~
     - Rafe complains that you can't instantiate an interface, and
       thinks this deficiency reflects poorly on the snippet library.
     - But wait! One more tab will let you choose ArrayList or
       LinkedList!
     - *Rafe*: Damn! They're smarter than I am. ... But what if I
       want to use a TreeList?
     - Now Rafe's just trolling.
   - *Rafe*: I think we should all pitch in and get a Lisp machine.
   - *Mish*: Why are you in vim?
     - *Andrew*: This is less.
     - *Mish*: So less is vim.
     - Mish is disappointed.
* The Aftermath
  - We are now all playing with http://wwwtyro.github.com/keyzen .
    - *Rafe*: SO IT HAS COME TO THIS
    - Rafe has been waiting to make that xkcd reference the entire
      session.
  - *Andrew*: Is that my dongle?
