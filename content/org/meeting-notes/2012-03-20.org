Meeting Notes 2012-03-20

* Trolling
  - First item on the agenda: Trolling.
  - *John*: Can I borrow your dongle?
    - He wants to show off his globe demo.
    - *Mish*: That has nothing to do with emacs!
    - *John*: It was written with emacs!
    - It's a spinning globe, backed by real data.
      - *John*: Real data that I generate on the fly.
  - *Andrew*: Look at this sticker I got! "Net neutrality, I won't waffle on."
    - Rafe reorganizes the words to make more sense.
  - A fly is trolling us.
    - *Rafe*: Stay away from my food!
  - *Mish*: Have we trolled enough?
* A Hunter-Gatherer Society
  - There is much discussion as to whether or not "Food" should be an item on
    the agenda.
  - *Rafe*: Is Koreana Korean food?
  - Andrew is assigned to getting food, via the nose game. The nose game will
    be the process for assigning food-gathering for all future meetings. 
    - *Rafe*: We should put that in our bylaws.
* Our Project
  - *Mish*: We're going to make a package by the end of the semeseter.
  - We discuss packages to write.
  - *Rafe*: Emacs MySpace client.
  - Emacs Starter Kit is too bloated. Mish suggests Penn Starter Kit.
    - *Rafe*: Is there an emacs mode for LC4?
    - PennSim integration!
  - *Mish*: Any other ideas?
    - *John*: Whoa.
* Potluck
  - *Mish*: Zach asked me to host an .emacs init file potluck.
    - Everyone brings their .emacs files.
  - *Andrew*: I keep getting "emacs quit unexpectedly." But I'm not running
    emacs.
  - *Mish*: Give me the dongle.
    - John's spinning globe is no longer projected :(
  - *Mish*: At some point I want to figure out how to use email!
  - Andrew doesn't organize his .emacs. He does ~cat >> .emacs~ whenever he
    wants to add anything.
