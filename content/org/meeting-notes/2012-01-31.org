Meeting Notes 2012-01-31

  - John Mayer presents: M-x emacs-club!
  - *John* : This is a Bring Your Own Laptop event.
             At some point it's going to be you're out of battery and that's it.
             Next week we might do something with a projector.
  - John asks how many are just here for the pizza. No one raises their hand.
    - *John* : Wow, you're all here for emacs? That's great!
               Or you're all lying liars.
  - *John* : It's our favorite editor that isn't a Google product.
             If they made Google Emacs I'd be really torn.
  - Sam Panzer stops by looking for the vim club meeting.
    - *John* : It's in the basement.
  - *John* : If you're on Windows, you can download a GUI version of emacs,
             but you're really going to want to shell into eniac.
  - The intro message looks sort of error-message-like.
  - Levine 315 is now over capacity.
    - This is Emacs Club. Standing room only.
  - There are many different levels of emacs use. One of them is
    "I browse the web in emacs."
  - *John* : Don't ask me what c stands for. You just memorize it.
  - We have http://emacsclub.com, running on emacs.
  - Like John, Mish asks how many people have used emacs before.
  - *Mish* : For some reason you want emacs to display a cat whenever
             you open it up.
  - *Mish* : Shout out what you want to tinker with.
    - rectangular selection of text.
    - diff within emacs
    - sending emails
    - John extolls the virtues of syntax highlighting.
      - *Mish* : If you invent your own language, you can write your own
                 syntax highlighter.
    - flymake
    - customize
    - formatting
    - Kevin asks about CoffeeMode, emacs' implementation of HTCPCP.
      - "You can probably guess how CoffeeMode came about... yadda yadda
        everything but make coffee... yadda yadda..." -
        http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CoffeeMode
    - version control
    - elisp
    - code completion
    - major/minor modes
    - org-mode
      - *Mish* : I can't resist teaching it to everyone!
    - dired
    - built-in help
    - *John* : Your homework is play around with the tutorial.
    - (tl;dr: "Can emacs--" "Yes.")
  - *John* : Now that Zach's here you should try M-x zone.
  - Mish points us to the help files at C-h h.
    - *Andrew* : C-h h just tells me how to say hello in different languages.
    - Mish meant C-h C-h.
    - *Mish* : The help pages are better than Google.
    - *John* : There it's just going to be StackOverflow.
    - *Mish* : Here it's going to be Richard Stallman.
  - *John* : Fork us on github!
  - Mish conducts the polls.
    - *John* : This is a democracy until we tell you it isn't.
  - Next meeting in two weeks.
  - *John* : vi is a great editor. We just like emacs better.
    - *Mish* : Wait, it doesn't have elisp, how do you customize it?
    - *Andrew* : Vimscript. I dunno if it's a real language.
