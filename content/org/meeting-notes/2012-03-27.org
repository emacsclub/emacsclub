Meeting Notes 2012-03-27

* Meeting Notes 2012-03-27
** The Greater Emacs Community
   - [[http://emacsmovies.org/blog/2012/03/24/terminology/][emacsmovies.org]] is also a fan of ~M-x zone~ (as well as
     ~animate-sequence~)
** Setup
   - Someone's tree thing is drawn on the whiteboard.
     - *John*: Let's get the schematics out of the way.
   - Braunstein, Orderer-Elect of Food, is absent.
     - *Rafe*: Koreana doesn't start taking orders until 5:30.
     - Andrew had class then so Rafe submitted the order for him.
   - Mish disapproves of the transparent blinds that do not filter the
     sun.
   - Mish pushes the potluck back until the last day of emacsclub.
     - *John*: I thought we were doing the potluck today!
     - *Rafe*: But I spent so much time on my init file today!
       - Rafe's init file is pretty now.
       - *Mish*: It's going to stay pretty until the potluck, though.
       - *Rafe*: No it won't. I'm just going to cat things to the end
         of it.
   - We have new members, so we all introduce ourselves.
     - Mish introduces himself as the leader.
     - *John*: I'm also the president, even though I don't do
       anything.
     - *Zach*: I'm Zach.
       - The sunlight is in his hair, unaffected by the transparent
         blinds.
       - *Mish*: You look like a god.
     - Andrew arrives.
       - *Rafe*: This is Andrew.
       - *Mish*: This is Andrew.
** Flymake
   - Mish inquires whether we should set up flymake in C or Java.
     - *Zach*: You have both working?
     - *Mish*: I have nothing working.
   - *Mish*: Zach will be leading us.
     - *Zach*: Through the Googling.
   - We all forage for usable C projects.
     - *John*: I'm going to do this with badbuf.
   - *Zach*: I like how there's a pedantic option for the compiler.
     - *John*: ~-pedantic~ is extra- ~-Wall~
   - *Mish*: There's a flymake for vim, Mr. Vim User.
   - Rafe's flymake currently works for Python and LaTeX.
   - Zach puts his makefile on pastebin, while marveling at the vast
     extent of pastebin's syntax highlighting options.
     - *Zach*: Did everyone get that address?
     - Mish just copied Zach's Makefile off the projector in the time
       it took to put it up on pastebin.
   - Mish complains about cross-pollination.
   - *Mish*: How do we not know how to global-set-key something? This
     is embarassing.
   - *Zach*: What's your Makefile called?
     - *Andrew*: What do you think it's called? Makefile!
** The Feast
   - The utensils and napkins from Koreana are wrapped in rubber
     bands.
     - *Rafe*: They went through painstaking effort to make these.
   - Rafe requests it be added to the record that next time we should
     prepare a stock of plates.
     - This time, however, our plates are Koreana container tops.
       - *Rafe*: Here is a plate.
       - *Todun*: Thank you.
     - Mish gets the real plate.
       - *Rafe*: As our leader, you get the only actual plate.
   - The sun shines directly through the highrise rooftop lounges.
   - *Mish*: Is everyone here?
     - *Rafe*: I'm here.
   - A Jimmy John's platter is proposed for next week's feast.
     - *Zach*: What about a Potbelly platter?
     - Whenever someone suggests Jimmy John's, Zach one-ups them.
   - As we get kicked out by the 7:15pm group, Mish gathers all his
     belongings.
     - *Mish*: Oh! My dongle!
