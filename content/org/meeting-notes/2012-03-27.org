Meeting Notes 2012-03-27

* The Greater Emacs Community
  - [[http://emacsmovies.org/blog/2012/03/24/terminology/][emacsmovies.org]] is also a fan of ~M-x zone~ (as well as
    ~animate-sequence~)
* Setup
  - Someone's tree thing is drawn on the whiteboard.
    - *John*: Let's get the schematics out of the way.
  - Braunstein, Orderer-Elect of Food, is absent.
    - *Rafe*: Koreana doesn't start taking orders until 5:30.
    - Andrew had class then so Rafe submitted the order for him.
  - Mish disapproves of the transparent blinds that do not filter the
    sun.
  - Mish pushes the potluck back until the last day of emacsclub.
    - *John*: I thought we were doing the potluck today!
    - *Rafe*: But I spent so much time on my init file today!
      - Rafe's init file is pretty now.
      - *Mish*: It's going to stay pretty until the potluck, though.
      - *Rafe*: No it won't. I'm just going to cat things to the end
        of it.
  - We have new members, so we all introduce ourselves.
    - Mish introduces himself as the leader.
    - *John*: I'm also the president, even though I don't do
      anything.
    - *Zach*: I'm Zach.
      - The sunlight is in his hair, unaffected by the transparent
        blinds.
      - *Mish*: You look like a god.
    - Andrew arrives.
      - *Rafe*: This is Andrew.
      - *Mish*: This is Andrew.
* Flymake
  - Mish inquires whether we should set up flymake in C or Java.
    - *Zach*: You have both working?
    - *Mish*: I have nothing working.
  - *Mish*: Zach will be leading us.
    - *Zach*: Through the Googling.
  - We all forage for usable C projects.
    - *John*: I'm going to do this with badbuf.
  - *Zach*: I like how there's a pedantic option for the compiler.
    - *John*: ~-pedantic~ is extra- ~-Wall~
  - *Mish*: There's a flymake for vim, Mr. Vim User.
  - Rafe's flymake currently works for Python and LaTeX.
  - Zach puts his makefile on pastebin, while marveling at the vast
    extent of pastebin's syntax highlighting options.
    - *Zach*: Did everyone get that address?
    - Mish just copied Zach's Makefile off the projector in the time
      it took to put it up on pastebin.
  - Mish complains about cross-pollination.
  - *Mish*: How do we not know how to global-set-key something? This
    is embarassing.
  - *Zach*: What's your Makefile called?
    - *Andrew*: What do you think it's called? Makefile!
* The Feast
  - The utensils and napkins from Koreana are wrapped in rubber
    bands.
    - *Rafe*: They went through painstaking effort to make these.
  - Rafe requests it be added to the record that next time we should
    prepare a stock of plates.
    - This time, however, our plates are Koreana container tops.
      - *Rafe*: Here is a plate.
      - *Todun*: Thank you.
    - Mish gets the real plate.
      - *Rafe*: As our leader, you get the only actual plate.
  - The sun shines directly through the highrise rooftop lounges.
  - *Mish*: Is everyone here?
    - *Rafe*: I'm here.
  - A Jimmy John's platter is proposed for next week's feast.
    - *Zach*: What about a Potbelly platter?
    - Whenever someone suggests Jimmy John's, Zach one-ups them.
  - As we get kicked out by the 7:15pm group, Mish gathers all his
    belongings.
    - *Mish*: Oh! My dongle!
