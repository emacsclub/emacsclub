Meeting Notes 2012-04-10

* The Greater Emacs Community
  - Emacs is "this awesome tool that gets overlooked, like people
    have some amazing sword in their cupboard and instead hack away
    at zombies with spoons." - [[http://emacsconf.herokuapp.com/][Nic Ferrier]]
* Focus group: The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory][Broken Windows Theory]]
  - John got yelled at for drawing on the Moore 100 windows with
    dry-erase markers (it doesn't damage the windows, but "we don't
    want to encourage it").
    - *John*: Just put up a sign that says to erase when you're
      done. And also have cameras and lasers.
    - *John*: Anyway, that ends the focus group discussion.
* Focus group: The energy crisis
  - Gas is expensive in California, unless you have a Tesla.
  - *Zach*: Have you ever driven cross-country?
    - *Mish*: Not this country.
* Focus group: Climate change
  - The Sky Lounge is a greenhouse.
    - *Rafe*: This is not an efficiently-designed room for the
      summertime.
* Focus group: Rafe's Potbelly Experience
  - This isn't actually a focus group, it's just a survey thing they
    sent him.
* Focus group: Time management
  - *Rafe*: I love how I can tell people I'm in a meeting when I'm
    here.
* Focus group: Emacs 24
  - *Zach*: It works... most of the time. Which is also my experience
    with emacs 23.
* Focus group: Emacs Uptime
  - *Rafe*: Unless you have legendary emacs uptime, that won't be
    sustainable.
    - Rafe's emacs uptime is 3 years.
  - *Andrew*: I get these popups that say "Emacs has crashed! Emacs
    has crashed!" and none of my emacs instances actually crashed.
    - It's the OS who cried SIGWOLF.
* Focus group: Smex
  - Mish's video card is kablooey.
  - smex gives Mish some weird errors.
  - Mish reprimands Rafe for not having ido.
    - *Mish*: You needed to have that a long time ago.
    - *Zach*: A long long time ago.
  - ~M-x smex~ is fun to pronounce.
  - With his newfound autocomplete powers, Zach discovers the function
    ~icicle-doremi-increment-swank-prefix-length+~
* Focus group: Flymake
  - Andrew found someone who had the exact same problem he had with
    flymake, except when he did what that guy did to fix it, it
    didn't work for him.
  - *Rafe*: Who were you, DenverCoder9? What did you see?
* Focus group: Music of the Spheres
  - The sun passes through the rooftop lounge of a different highrise
    from last time. The earth has rotated!
    - Rafe makes things up about astrophysics.
      - *Rafe*: The MOOOOOON!
* Focus group: Backwards compatibility
  - *Zach*: They wouldn't take it out. It's a really useful feature.
    - *Rafe*: Stallman works in mysterious ways.
* Focus group: Computer graphics
  - Rafe is impressed by the Electric Sheep.
    - *Rafe*: I'm glad I don't have this screen saver. I wouldn't get
      anything done.
    - *Zach*: Yeah, the first couple years you have it it takes up a
      lot of your time.
    - *John*: If you ever go to Brent Yorgey's office hours, distract
      him and then watch his screensaver. It's xmonad, so it's all
      Haskell people writing Klein bottle screensavers.
* Focus group: Dongle
  - I have to leave early, but it is safe to assume a dongle
    reference was made in my absence.
