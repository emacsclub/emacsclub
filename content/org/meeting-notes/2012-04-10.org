* Meeting Notes 2012-04-10
** The Greater Emacs Community
   - Emacs is "this awesome tool that gets overlooked, like people
     have some amazing sword in their cupboard and instead hack away
     at zombies with spoons." - [[http://emacsconf.herokuapp.com/][Nic Ferrier]]
** Focus group: The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory][Broken Windows Theory]]
   - John got yelled at for drawing on the Moore 100 windows with
     dry-erase markers (it doesn't damage the windows, but "we don't
     want to encourage it").
     - *John*: Just put up a sign that says to erase when you're
       done. And also have cameras and lasers.
     - *John*: Anyway, that ends the focus group discussion.
** Focus group: The energy crisis
   - Gas is expensive in California, unless you have a Tesla.
   - *Zach*: Have you ever driven cross-country?
     - *Mish*: Not this country.
** Focus group: Climate change
   - The Sky Lounge is a greenhouse.
     - *Rafe*: This is not an efficiently-designed room for the
       summertime.
** Focus group: Rafe's Potbelly Experience
   - This isn't actually a focus group, it's just a survey thing they
     sent him.
** Focus group: Time management
   - *Rafe*: I love how I can tell people I'm in a meeting when I'm
     here.
** Focus group: Emacs 24
   - *Zach*: It works... most of the time. Which is also my experience
     with emacs 23.
** Focus group: Emacs Uptime
   - *Rafe*: Unless you have legendary emacs uptime, that won't be
     sustainable.
     - Rafe's emacs uptime is 3 years.
   - *Andrew*: I get these popups that say "Emacs has crashed! Emacs
     has crashed!" and none of my emacs instances actually crashed.
     - It's the OS who cried SIGWOLF.
** Focus group: Smex
   - Mish's video card is kablooey.
   - smex gives Mish some weird errors.
   - Mish reprimands Rafe for not having ido.
     - *Mish*: You needed to have that a long time ago.
     - *Zach*: A long long time ago.
   - ~M-x smex~ is fun to pronounce.
   - With his newfound autocomplete powers, Zach discovers the function
     ~icicle-doremi-increment-swank-prefix-length+~
** Focus group: Flymake
   - Andrew found someone who had the exact same problem he had with
     flymake, except when he did what that guy did to fix it, it
     didn't work for him.
   - *Rafe*: Who were you, DenverCoder9? What did you see?
** Focus group: Music of the Spheres
   - The sun passes through the rooftop lounge of a different highrise
     from last time. The earth has rotated!
     - Rafe makes things up about astrophysics.
       - *Rafe*: The MOOOOOON!
** Focus group: Backwards compatibility
   - *Zach*: They wouldn't take it out. It's a really useful feature.
     - *Rafe*: Stallman works in mysterious ways.
** Focus group: Computer graphics
   - Rafe is impressed by the Electric Sheep.
     - *Rafe*: I'm glad I don't have this screen saver. I wouldn't get
       anything done.
     - *Zach*: Yeah, the first couple years you have it it takes up a
       lot of your time.
     - *John*: If you ever go to Brent Yorgey's office hours, distract
       him and then watch his screensaver. It's xmonad, so it's all
       Haskell people writing Klein bottle screensavers.
** Focus group: Dongle
   - I have to leave early, but it is safe to assume a dongle
     reference was made in my absence.
