Meeting Notes 2012-04-03

* Setup
  - Mish put Google Analytics up last week. We've already gotten three
    visitors from Zurich.
  - Special thanks to Michael S., who accidentally left his
    (working!) power strip in the room.
  - A diagram of Todun's 555 project is on the whiteboard.
    - The databases were once cylinders, as is traditional, but the need for
      more writing space transformed them into conical frusta.
  - The Box O' Sandwiches arrives, carried by John, Mish, and Rafe.
  - Zach and John discuss matters of the Haskell.
    - Rafe complains about lack of purity in purity restrictions.
    - *Mish*: These kids are Haskelling it up.
  - Happy birthday John!
    - ~M-x animate-birthday-present~
    - The birthday present is martini-swan-dived, then dissociated.
* Tutorial (Reprise)
  - We're all eating, so Mish does an Emacs tutorial.
  - *Mish*: It assumes you're smart, so that'll help.
  - *Mish*: Emacs is self-documenting. That's what makes it better
    than all the other editors.
  - In the midst of his presentation, Mish is chatted at.
    - *Lucy*: MISH
    - *Lucy*: CAN ALL OF MY BEST FRIENDS AT PENN JUST HANG OUT AT ONE PLACE
  - *Mish*: Up down left right those let you move around. You can
    also use C-f C-b C-n C-p.
    - ~C-p C-p C-n C-n C-b C-f C-b C-f b a~
  - Mish cascades frame-splitting infinitely.
    - *Rafe*: I don't believe you can actually go infinitely.
  - He then cycles through the frames.
    - *Mish*: The order is top to bottom, left to right.
    - *Andrew*: Really? I always thought it was just random.
  - Finally, he kills the buffers.
    - ~C-x C-b C-x o d d x y y~
    - *Mish*: The buffer displaying the buffers is also a buffer, and
      I can kill it too. 
    - *Rafe*: That's mean.
  - *Mish*: ~M-x shell~ is cool and handy if you never want to leave
    emacs. You should never want to leave emacs.
* Flymake
  - We browse the java flymake docs. Rafe didn't know that java had
    lint built in.
    - *Rafe*: I'll run it on one of my students' files, see what kind
      of output we get.
    - *man javac*: -Xlint Enable all recommended warnings. In this release,
      all available warnings are recommended.
    - This isn't actually lint. This is disappointing.
  - yasnippit autocompletes ~defun~ for Mish. He tabs to the docstring line.
    - *Andrew*: You can just leave it blank.
    - *Rafe*: No, that breaks the invariant of emacs being all
      self-documenting.
  - Next week will include code style checking.
    - *Zach*: All the cool kids are checking their styles.
  - John raises the blinds, singing the theme from 2001.
  - An hour later, Mish retrieves his dongle.
